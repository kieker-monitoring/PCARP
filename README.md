## Replication

The following wil walk you through the complete pipeline using the UXsim application as an example.
Note: it is important to do the static analysis first, as to not skew the static analysis results with the added code for the dynamic analysis intrumentation.

### Static Analysis

From the root, run the static analyzer.

```
time python3 tools/pyparse/src/pyparse/pyparse.py \
 -i UXsim/uxsim \
 -o bin/uxsim-static \
 -m both -e -v
```

### Dynamic analysis

Build and install the Otkt utilities (collector and python module).
```
cd otkt-gen
make
cd ..
```

Instrument and install UXsim. 
```
cd UXsim
../scripts/instrument.sh
python3 -m build .
pip install dist/uxsim*
cd ..
```

Launch the collector.
```
cd otkt-gen
make run
```

From another terminal, run the entrypoint.
```
python3 python/UXsim-test.py
```

The collector can be stopped. Kieker logs have been created in `/tmp`. Transfer them to the bin directory.
```
ll /tmp/kieker*
cp -r /tmp/kieker* ./bin/
```

## Running the pipeline

Now, run the pipeline.

```
./scripts/pipeline.sh bin/kieker* bin/uxsim-static combined-uxsim
```
