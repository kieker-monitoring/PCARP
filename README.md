## Package structure

### UXsim

[UXsim](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim) is the app provided for the guided example.

### Tools

[Tools](tools) contains the [kieker](tools/oceandsl-tools/) tool suite and the [static analyser](https://github.com/Misrobody/pyparse#).

### Scripts

[scripts](scripts) contains the pipeline scripts and utilities needed for the guided example.

### Python

[python](python) contains the fix for the sar tool, the graph grouper and the dynamic analysis entrypoint.

### Otkt-gen

[otkt-gen](otkt-gen) contains the collector and the otkt python module necessary for the dynamic analysis.

### Data

[data](data) contains:
 - The pipeline outputs for the 5 timed examples, including all the in between steps and the generated graphs.
 - The monitoring data required to launch the pipeline without having to run the static and/or dynamic analyses before hand.

## Replication

The following wil walk you through the complete pipeline using the UXsim application as an example. You can use the same methodology to replicate the other examples.
If you want to try out the pipeline without running the dynamic and static analyses, go straight to 'running the pipeline' and run it with the provided data in `data/monitoring-data`.
Note: it is important to do the static analysis first, as to not skew the static analysis results with the added code for the dynamic analysis intrumentation.

### Static Analysis

From the root, run the static analyzer.

```
time python3 tools/pyparse/src/pyparse/pyparse.py \
 -i UXsim/uxsim \
 -o bin/uxsim-static \
 -m both -e -v
```

### Dynamic analysis

Build and install the Otkt utilities (collector and python module).
```
cd otkt-gen
make
cd ..
```

Instrument and install UXsim.
  
```
cd UXsim
../scripts/instrument.sh
python3 -m build .
pip install dist/uxsim*
cd ..
```

Launch the collector.
```
cd otkt-gen
make run
```

From another terminal, run the entrypoint.
```
python3 python/UXsim-test.py
```

The collector can be stopped. Kieker logs have been created in `/tmp`. Transfer them to the bin directory.
```
ll /tmp/kieker*
cp -r /tmp/kieker* ./bin/
```

## Running the pipeline

Now, run the pipeline.

```
./scripts/pipeline.sh bin/kieker* bin/uxsim-static combined-uxsim
```
